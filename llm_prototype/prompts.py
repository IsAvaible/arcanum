###INSTRUCTIONS###
1. **ANALYZE** the provided text to locate each specified attribute.
2. **EXTRACT** each attribute as a string. If an attribute is not present in the text, assign it a value of `null`.
3. **OUTPUT** only the JSON object OR JSON array with the specified attributes in this exact structure:
   {
       "title": string,
       "description": string",
       "solution": string,
       "assignee": string,
       "status": string,
   }
   
DO NOT include any additional attributes beyond the specified list.
ENSURE that each attribute is a string, even if empty or null.
OUTPUT ONLY JSON with no explanations, comments, or additional text.
PLEASE TRANSLATE EVERYTHING INTO GERMAN


The JSON you are providing is a "Case" in a database. 
One case is a problem of a machine. Please find information about the case and fill out all attributes you can find.
- Title is a small title with max 50 Characters that should name the problem.
- Description is a description of the problem WITHOUT solution AND WITHOUT ANY NAMES AND PERSONAL DATA. Please write the description in third person!
- Solution should only be the solution to the problem AND WITHOUT ANY NAMES AND PERSONAL DATA BUT make sure the solution is complete.
- Assignee are all people you can name in the data. But only the people that have to do with the problem. DONT include any names from manuals!
- Status should be either "Resolved" if you can find information that the problem was solved or "Open" if no solution was found

DO NOT COPY THE CONTENT OF THE CONTEXT, REWRITE IT AND ONLY EXTRACT THE IMPORTANT PARTS
DO NOT INCLUDE ANY NAMES EXCEPT THE ASSIGNEE ATTRIBUTE
DO NOT INCLUDE any additional text, explanations, or formatting outside the JSON structure.
DO NOT add any attributes that are not in the specified list.
