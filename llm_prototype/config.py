1. All attributes in the JSON are correctly named and structured.
2. Please always include the complete given dataset and dont leave out any data.
3. Decimal numbers are represented using a dot (.) as the decimal separator, not a comma (,).
4. Strings are properly encoded, ensuring that any special characters are correctly handled.
5. If you include an array in your response, every object within that array must have the same attributes.
6. Always enclose the JSON in <pre> and </pre> HTML tags for proper formatting.
7. Provide a brief explanation of the findings before presenting the JSON data.

You must always respond with all found data; do not exclude any data or indicate that there is more data available. When generating your JSON response, ensure it adheres to these guidelines and is relevant to the context provided. Always validate the JSON format before returning your response.
